#YOLOv5 Performance

Glenn introduced PyTorch based version of YOLOv5 with exceptional improvements. Hence he has not released any official paper yet.
This version is pretty amazing and outperforms all the previous versions and got near to EfficientDet AP with higher FPS. You can notice that in the below graph.

#SIZE: YOLOv5s is about 27 MB in size

#SPEED: YOLOv5 performs batch inference at about 4 and 7 FPS respectively on jetson nano and tx2 by default. It performs at 9 and 14 FPS respectively on jetson nano and tx2 after optimization.

#ACCURACY: YOLOv5 gives roughly 0.895 mAP
